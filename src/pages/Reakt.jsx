          In web development, there are many
          frameworks that developers can choose from. Each framework has it's
          strengths and weaknesses. At the end of the day, the choice one makes depends
           on many factors. There are no rights or wrongs! This article is
          going to be about React native, an open source framework that was
          developed by Facebook in 2013 and became open source in 2015.

          I first came into contact with React in the fall of 2020 when I took
          part in a 12 week web development boot-camp. React was the front end
          framework of choice in the boot-camp and boy did I struggle! I found
          out that for somebody with basic knowledge of

          So whats the fuss with React? The answers to that question are many.
          All i know is React is growing in popularity and it's probably a good
          idea to at least be familiar with it if you want to work with frontend
          web development. This blog will be most useful to beginners, since i
          myself am one. To make it easier to understand the different
          techniques that are used in React, i will create a small application
          so that you can code along.

          I have added CSS and Github but they are not necessary. CSS is good to

            Our project folder is now setup. React has generated alot of files
            for us. Of all the files and folders that were generated, App.js and
            index.js are the most important ones. Since we have already agreed
            that we will be using JSX for our blog, rename those files to
            App.jsx and index.jsx.

          Components are the building blocks of our application. They are
          similar to JavaScript functions because they accept arguments called
          props. For our blog, we will create a "Home" and a "React" component.
          We will also create a "Navbar" and a "Footer". To do so, do as follows:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li class="list">
            Create two folders folders in your src folder. One called{" "}

          <li class="list">

          <li class="list">
            Type <kbd>rafce</kbd> in that file and visual studio will
            automatically generate a template for our home component. This is a
            React shortcut that is good to know so we don't need to create the
            function manually
          </li>
          <p class="text-secondary">
            <strong>Result:</strong>

            have added a picture of myself
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            Create another component in your pages folder for your React page
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            Create two components, but this time in your components folder. Call

            Our components are done. I added all the code for the "navbar"
            component. It contains routing and other React native topics

        <p class="text-secondary">
          We added the navLink element to our navbar earlier beacuse it 
          lets you specify the routes to our components. In
          the picture below, the "/" after the equal sign is our root path. For our
          react component, our path will be{" "}
            <em>"/react"</em>.
          </p>
          <p class="text-secondary">Great, now we have fixed our routing.</p>

      <section id="rendering">
        <h2 class="display-6">Rendering</h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          Take a look at the pictures below:
          <div>
            <img src={el} alt="..." />

          <div>

        <p class="text-secondary">
          React-DOM is a package that has methods that can be used to manipulate
          the DOM. In the context of React, we manipulate the DOM using the body "root" id and the React-DOM method "render". So if we look at the 
          picture above again, you will see that the <em>element</em> is rendered into an element with an 
          id called "root", that is the body. The element that we render is the App component
          of our react application. All our other components are imported into our App component.

          <strong>A couple of things to note from the picture above:</strong>

            "BrowserRouter" must be installed otherwise "Route" won't work

          <li class="list-group-item">
            "exact path" makes sure that the exact root that we want is matched
            otherwise all roots that start with "/" will be matched
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">
            "Switch" makes sure that react stops looking for routes to match
            once it has matched a route and only that route is rendered.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="state">
        <h2 class="display-6">State</h2>
        <p class="text-secondary">
          State can be hard to explain, but i'm going to give it a try. The
          Oxford dictionary defines state as "the mental, emotional or physical
          condition that a person or thing is in". That tells you that state in
          the context of web development has to do with a condition. That is,
          has the user logged on or not, or is the checkbox checked or not? This
          means that you need a default state, for example that you set to
          "false", which can be set to "true" when the user does something. {""}
          Up to now, we have only worked with functions. Such functions are
          called functional components in react. If you have a functional
          component and want to use state, you need to rewrite the functionional
          component and make it a class component. It's possible to get the same
          results with functional components, but you have to use hooks and
          thats a topic for another day.
