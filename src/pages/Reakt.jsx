          In the world of web development there are many frameworks that
          developers can choose, each with their own strength and weaknesses. At
          the end of the day, the choice of stack depends of many things and
          there are no rights or wrongs. This blog is going to be about React
          native. React native is an open source front end framework that was
          developed by Facebook and has become quite popular of late. I first
          came into contact with React in the fall of 2020 when I took part in a
          12 week full-stack web development boot-camp. The boot-camp organizers
          chose React as the front end framework and boy did I struggle! I found
          out that for somebody with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and
          JavaScript, React has a steep learning curve. Now that the boot-camp
          is finished, I am studying software quality testing and we have a
          course in front-end development. As part of that, we were given a list
          of subjects to pick from and develop a website about. React native was
          on that list and I chose it because I saw its potential in the
          boot-camp and would like to use this opportunity to learn more about
          it. Naturally, I wonâ€™t have the time to create a comprehensive blog
          about React native. For that I would need at least a year! Because of
          my time constraint, I will only focus on the things that I found
          difficult in the boot-camp. I will focus on the following parts:
